## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - State manager

### What I learned

Implemented Redux for the state management for the first time in my projects. It makes life of state easier.

### Continued development

Will try to continue to make more fully fledged appication, by implementing sign in and sign up features.

### Useful resources

- [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Easier way to organize reducers, actions, stores an to dispatch functions.
